Know why I created this blog.

First of all, I suck at writing lengthy things when it's about me. I like writing explanations when I do them for other people, but the reason why I haven't had a website for so long is because I'm bad at managing them.

So I thought,

> "Why don't I make this as a hub for me and my buddies, where we can share ideas and paste something directly from Google Docs onto a badass _website_?"

And thus, the website where I don't proofread as much is born! This is also where I decided to keep my thoughts, because Dreamwidth, Spacehey, and other blogging platforms simply don't work for me.

Also, the girlfriend inspired me to build this simple ol' reliable. It isn't beautiful in any way, but should suffice for both personal journalism and functional portfolio pieces. If you like anything about this that you see, do contact me. Throw your shot, because life's too unfair not to.

Best of luck to all readers and thank you to GitHub for providing me a wonderful platform.
