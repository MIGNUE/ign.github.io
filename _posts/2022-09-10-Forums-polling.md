Put down your thoughts on whether we should have a forum

This becomes more relevant in the far future where I do build a base with like-minded peers wanting to chime in on some ideas. I know for sure that my best friends would be the first supporters. Once I set up the Disqus, you're free to let me know ahead of time (perhaps in a few years) what you think!

I think it would be an interesting archive for the purposes I'll list below.

1. Regardless of any social media sites shutting down, we'll be able to keep a local storage on things we deem important.
2. The rules on our platform would be _okay_ for a drop of degeneracy. What's important is that people stay civilized.
3. The counterculture lives on! No, I'm not pertaining to any alt-right causes, but more on Generation Z. To understand one, you have to be one. But, to create a nice centralized medium for socializing, you have to have the skills to understand how communication works. Technicalities are another thing and is something in the works.
4. As I grow older, my friends will have graduated from interrelated courses that would make us more knowledgeable by then.

It'll be a little more difficult to execute with all things considered, but I can at least foresee a place where long-form text belongs. Nano-journalism over at Twitter can be useful, but where do all the long essays go? Plus journalism, that's another fun thing. Where's the too-long-have-read people of Gen Z discussions, anyway? Classic forums have their charm, and Reddit's... turning in a direction I don't like.

Alternately, I also want to be able to create a very weird portfolio here where I recommend you to my friends. Most of them write as well. I'll definitely let you know if it's made by me or by them.
