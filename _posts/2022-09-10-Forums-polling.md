Put down your thoughts on whether we should have a forum

This becomes more relevant in the future where we decide to build a base with like-minded peers wanting throw in a few ideas. I know for sure that my best friends would be the first supporters. Once I set up the Disqus, you're free to let me know ahead of time (perhaps in a few years) what you think!

This might be an interesting archive for the purposes I'll list below.

1. Regardless of any social media sites shutting down, we'll be able to keep a local storage on things we deem important.
2. The rules on our platform would be _okay_ for a drop of degeneracy. What's important is that people stay civilized.
3. The counterculture lives on! No, I'm not pertaining to any alt-right causes, but more on Generation Z. To understand one, you have to be one. But, to create a nice centralized medium for socializing, you have to have the skills to understand how communication works. Technicalities are another thing and is something in the works.
4. As I grow older, my friends will have graduated from interrelated courses that would make us more knowledgeable by then.

It'll be a little more difficult to execute with all things considered, but I can at least foresee a place where long-form text belongs. Nano-journalism over at Twitter can be useful, but where do all the long essays and patient readers go? Plus journalism, that's another fun thing. Classic forums have their charm, and Reddit's... turning in a direction I don't like.

But, I don't know. What kind of twist could we put that exceeds basic student forums?

Alternately, I also want to be able to create a very weird portfolio here where I recommend you to my friends. Most of them write as well. I'll definitely let you know if it's made by me or by them.
