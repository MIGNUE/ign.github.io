Ideas?

As you know, I named the website "Fresh as Mints" as homage to my best friend's name suggestion. She allowed me to post their works here, and if I have to comment on it, they're fantastic. C usually works on fiction and likes playing Genshin Impact.

In my opinion, Fresh as Mints strikes me like this scenario in class where people would try to rob the only person with chewing gum. Mint sounds a little similar, except that people ask for mints when there's no gum left and they're ridding themselves of anxiety and hunger.

Meanwhile, "Mintsarewithme" reminds me of both the meanings I've described and "to mint", meaning to create something **fresh** and new. Or to associate with the big bucks. Aha!

But I digress. As an extension of this already awesome name, I thought...

> "Perhaps we could add a pun. What about "Mintosey"?"

I know, I know. These ideas should be patented! But with the way things are, it's better that I first write about it to make sure I can prove I did it first. Thanks to GitHub, it shows every date and every edit precisely when I've uploaded the file.

Anyway, I thought to perhaps use Mintosey for a future project which means "meant to say" or "meant to see". It's a double heteronym, meaning it's spelled the same but said differently and with different meanings.

I'll have to consult the buddies first, obviously. Maybe they have something better in mind?

Anyway, that's all for now. 

Tl;dr: we're brainstorming for a  fictional application (for now) while my brain allows me to.
