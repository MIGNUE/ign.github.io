Ideas?

As you know, I named the website "Fresh as Mints" as homage to my best friend's name suggestion. They allowed me to post their works here which are fantastic. She usually works on fiction and likes playing Genshin Impact.

As an extension of this already awesome name, I thought...

> Perhaps we could add a pun. What about "Mintosey"?

I know, I know. These ideas should be patented! But with the way things are, it's better that I first write about it to make sure I can prove I did it first. Thanks to GitHub, it shows every date and every edit precisely when I've uploaded the file.

Anyway, I thought to perhaps use Mintosey for a future project which means "meant to say" or "meant to see". It's a double heteronym, meaning it's spelled the same but said differently and with different meanings.

I'll have to consult the buddies first, obviously. Maybe they have something better in mind?

Anyway, that's all for now. Tl;dr, we're brainstorming for a (for now) fictional application while my brain allows me to.
