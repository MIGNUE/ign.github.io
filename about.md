Know more about the Author.


This probably won't be as cohesive and organic as interacting with me, but it helps to know some _background_ on the people you're following.

I'm Lael, dentistry student and your unrivaled _writer-slash-community-manager_. I had a head injury, that's all you need to know. 

### For the hungrier

Most times, I'm a jack-of-all-trades. Other times, I hyperfocus on learning one thing at a time. People have convinced me that I make great ideas. (I should begin patenting!) I'm an authorial speaker — meaning I'm the occasional killjoy, but most importantly (according to my family)... I'm capable of learning medicine!

Sort of.

Oh, forget it. I'd rather mess with technological _gim-gams_.

I'm struggling right now, but trying my best to advance my career in the right direction. If you're the "guiding light" type of person, listen.

Teach me like I'm an absorbent sponge fit for doing great things.

I do creative non-fiction, non-fiction, and technical writing. If you're looking for fiction, you're better off consulting my [partner](mailto:p0ltervale@gmail.com). Here's a library of her [book reviews](https://deadpoetics.wordpress.com/).

The tools I use are Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Celtx, and what have you. My grammar correction tools are Grammarly and ProWritingAid. I won't use these for the blog, obviously.

## About my pieces

- I write with style. I’m a big fan of wordplay. Have you heard of Bo Burnham? Nellie McKay?
- Thanks to being in the theatre club and being taught by amazing English teachers, I can write about most things under the sun.
- I practice using the AP Stylebook, occasionally dabbling on Faulkner’s style for giggles, and on my way to doing other writing ventures.
