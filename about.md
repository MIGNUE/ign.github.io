Some information about you!

### More Information

Writer. Idea man. Authorial speaker. Hardware repair. Potential dentist (because my hands are wonderful).

History and ongoing: PlayerAuctions, GamersDecide; FandomSpot; Growtopia University; Shad4w's Official Craft; University Council Secretary

**Content brief:**

• I made a short opinion piece for Time Magazine in March 2019 about Nobel Prize laureate and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa's case on cyber libel.

• I write for game websites. Most of my articles rank first page on Google. 

• Growtopia University is a Facebook community I owned when I was 14, built from the ground up from zero to 42K+ members.

• I've been writing since I was seven. Since two, for gaming. I'm 19 now — presentable with a flourishing private portfolio.

• Right now, I'm in a dental college I passed with my hands and writing skills. I aced several of these admission tests (one in particular was a pages-long essay questionnaire).

**About my pieces:**
• I write with style. I'm a big fan of wordplay. Have you heard of Bo Burnham? Nellie McKay?
I choose not to be esoteric. Rather, I'm just consistent. I believe profoundness should come from the point made.
• I practice using the AP Stylebook, occasionally dabbling on Faulkner's style for giggles, and on my way to doing other writing ventures.
