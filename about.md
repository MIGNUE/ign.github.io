Know more about the Author.

This probably won't be as cohesive and organic as interacting with me, but it helps to know some _background_ on the people you're following.

I'm Lael, college student and your unrivaled _writer-slash-community-manager_. Rarely do you see a mix of both extroversion and keenness to linguistic detail.


### For the hungrier

Most times, I'm a jack-of-all-trades. Other times, I hyperfocus on one hobby till my brain says, "next!" I know how to innovate thanks to leading an interesting life. I'm an authorial speaker — meaning I'm the occasional killjoy, but here comes the weird part... I'm capable of learning medicine!

Sort of.

Oh, forget it. I'd rather mess with technological _gim-gams_ and the things I actually enjoy doing.

I'm struggling right now, but trying my best to advance my career in the right direction. If you're the "guiding light" type of person, listen.

Teach me like I'm an absorbent sponge fit for doing great things.


## Relevant experiences

Previously worked on PlayerAuctions, GamersDecide; FandomSpot; Growtopia University; various Minecraft Classic servers; and in the university as the Student Council Secretary.

I do creative non-fiction, non-fiction, and technical writing. If you're looking for fiction, you're better off consulting my [partner](mailto:p0ltervale@gmail.com). Here's a library of her [book reviews](https://deadpoetics.wordpress.com/).

The tools I use are Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Celtx, and what have you. My grammar correction tools are Grammarly and ProWritingAid. I won't use these for the blog. Puts me in some sort of mental paralysis if I do it for fun.

## About my pieces

- I write with style. I’m a big fan of wordplay. Have you heard of Bo Burnham? Nellie McKay?
- Thanks to being in the theatre club and being taught by amazing English teachers, I can write about most things under the sun.
- I practice using the AP Stylebook, occasionally dabbling on Faulkner’s style for giggles, and on my way to doing other writing ventures.
