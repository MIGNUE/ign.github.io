### More Information

Previously worked at PlayerAuctions, GamersDecide; FandomSpot; Growtopia University; Shad4w's Official Craft; and in the university as the Student Council Secretary. _(wink)_

Specifically, I do creative non-fiction, non-fiction, and technical writing. If you're looking for fiction, you're better off consulting my partner at p0ltervale@gmail.com.

**Quick credentials:**

- **I wrote a short opinion piece for Time Magazine in March 2019.** This was about the Nobel Prize laureate Maria Ressa's case on cyber libel.
- **I have experience as a campus-wide secretary and class secretary.**
- **Currently, I write for game websites.** Most of my articles rank first page on Google. 
- **Growtopia University** is a Facebook community I owned when I was 14, **built from the ground up** from zero to 42K+ members.
- I've been writing since I was seven. I'm 19 now â€” presentable with a flourishing private portfolio.
- Right now, I'm in a dental college I passed with my skills. I aced several of these admission tests (one in particular was a pages-long essay questionnaire).

**About my pieces:**

- **I write with style.** I'm a big fan of wordplay. Have you heard of **Bo Burnham? Nellie McKay?**
- Thanks to being in the theatre club and being taught by amazing _English teachers_, I can probably write about anything under the bus.
- Let's not be esoteric. I try my best to be consistent. I believe _profoundness_ should come from the point made.
- I practice using the AP Stylebook, occasionally dabbling on Faulkner's style for giggles, and on my way to doing other writing ventures.
